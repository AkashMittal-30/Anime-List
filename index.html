                    <p class="descp">
                        It was hard to decide between Attack on Titan and Naruto shippuden. The only reason why i have kept Naruto shippuden below Attack on Titan is that it contains a lot a lot of fillers. Fillers aside, the main storyline of Naruto Shippuden is quite good and motivating. It shows what hard work and dedication results in. Naruto whose dream is to become a hokage overcome several challenges that lay in his path and eventually saves the world. There are many life lessons hidden in his tale which makes it worth watching.

                    <p class="descp">
                        When its first season was released, it wasn't quite famous but the turn of events at the end of 2nd season totally took it to another level. What once seem as a story of three kids who wanted to see a ocean but restricted inside walls due to the fear of titans, changed it course when a whole lot of mystery uncovers before them. Its a total rollar coaster ride and the way it was presented is simply worth praising. If you love mystery/Drama Genre then its a must watch.

                    <p class="descp">
                        Well, here comes my most favorite series. The reason why I kept it at 2nd instead of 1st is that, newbies in the field of animes might not get attracted towards its animation and music themes and the first 6 episodes are really slow at pace. But as one rightfully said, patience bear fruitful results. Its main strength is its plot, the plot is really very creatively written and at the end you just can't stop praising it. The plot revolves around time travel and how a young scientist struggles to save his friends from the dire consequences of time travel.

                    <p class="descp">
                        After tough competition, here comes Death Note which is almost in every aspect number 1. Music themes are really superb and storyline is just fantastic. The tug-of-war of brain between two detectives gets very nasty as the story proceeds. Writer is truly a mastermind to write such stories. The twist and turns in between the show would stick you to it. Its a must watch series if you love creative thinking
